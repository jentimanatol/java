### Instructional Objectives
Through exposure to lectures, demonstrations, hands-on activities, individual projects, and examinations, students will learn to successfully analyze, design, and code programs requiring the use of abstract data types. They will also gain an in-depth understanding of their significance and the role they play in the production of robust code. The successful student will leave this course prepared to address ADT in other languages such as C/C++.

### Course Requirements
Please see the grading section below.
