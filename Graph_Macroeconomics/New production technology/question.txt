Let’s analyze the effect of new production technology on the market for DVDs:

New Production Technology: This typically increases the efficiency of production, leading to a decrease in production costs. As a result, the supply curve will shift to the right.
Shift in Supply Curve: Using the line drawing tool, you would draw a new supply curve to the right of the original supply curve and label it as ‘New Line’.
New Equilibrium Point: The new supply curve intersects the demand curve at a new point. Using the point drawing tool, you would plot this new equilibrium point and label it as ‘E’.
Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Draw the New Supply Curve: Shift the original supply curve (S) to the right and label it ‘New Line’.
Plot the New Equilibrium Point: Identify where the new supply curve intersects the demand curve (D) and plot this point, labeling it ‘E’.
This new equilibrium point will typically be at a lower price and a higher quantity compared to the original equilibrium, reflecting the increased supply due to the new production technology.
