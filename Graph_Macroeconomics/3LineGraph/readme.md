# Purple Potato Market Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of a government-imposed price ceiling on the purple potato market. Specifically, it calculates the deadweight loss resulting from the price ceiling.

## Market Details
Consider the market for purple potatoes with the following parameters:
- **Price Ceiling:** $30 per pound
- **Equilibrium Price:** $40 per pound
- **Equilibrium Quantity:** 2,500 pounds
- **Quantity Demanded at $30:** 3,000 pounds
- **Quantity Supplied at $30:** 2,000 pounds

## Graphical Representation
The graph below shows the purple potato market:

- X-axis: Pounds of purple potatoes per day
- Y-axis: Price per pound

### Demand Curve
- Points: (1000, 70), (1500, 60), (2000, 50), (2500, 40), (3000, 30), (3500, 20), (4000, 10)
- Downward sloping

### Supply Curve
- Points: (1000, 10), (1500, 20), (2000, 30), (2500, 40), (3000, 50), (3500, 60), (4000, 70)
- Upward sloping

### Price Ceiling
- Horizontal line at $30
- Intersects demand and supply curves at different quantities

## Calculation of Deadweight Loss
To calculate the deadweight loss (DWL) due to the price ceiling, we need to find the area of the triangle formed by the price ceiling, the demand curve, and the supply curve.

### Given:
- Equilibrium Price: $40
- Equilibrium Quantity: 2,500 pounds
- Price Ceiling: $30
- Quantity Demanded at $30: 3,000 pounds
- Quantity Supplied at $30: 2,000 pounds

### Deadweight Loss Triangle:
- Base (difference in quantity): \(3,000 - 2,000 = 1,000 \text{ pounds}\)
- Height (difference in price): \(40 - 30 = 10 \text{ dollars}\)

### Area of the Triangle (DWL):


\[ \text{DWL} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]




\[ \text{DWL} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1,000 \times 10 \]




\[ \text{DWL} = 5,000 \text{ dollars} \]



So, the deadweight loss is **$5,000**.

## Conclusion
The imposition of a price ceiling in the purple potato market leads to a deadweight loss of $5,000, indicating the efficiency loss due to the government intervention.

### Area of the Triangle (DWL):
```java
DWL = (1/2) * base * height
DWL = (1/2) * 1,000 * 10
DWL = 5,000 dollars
