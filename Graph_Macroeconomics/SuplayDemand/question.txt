A government decides to set a price ceiling on bread so that bread is affordable to the poor. The conditions of demand and supply are given in the table below. What is the equilibrium price before the price ceiling? What will the excess supply or the shortage be if the price ceiling is set at $2.40?
Price	Qd	Qs
$1.60	9,000	5,000
$2.00	8,500	5,500
$2.40	8,000	6,400
$2.80	7,500	7,500
$3.20	7,000	9,000
$3.60	6,500	11,000
$4.00	6,000	15,000
Question 33Select one:
a.
$2.80; 1,600 shortage
b.
$2.40; 500 excess supply
c.
$2.80; 1,600 excess supply
d.
$2.40; 1,600 shortage
Incorrect. Find the price at which quantity demanded = quantity supplied. At a price of $2.40, check the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied.

Letâ€™s break this down step by step:

Equilibrium Price: The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded (Qd) equals the quantity supplied (Qs). From the table, we see that at $2.80, Qd = Qs = 7,500. So, the equilibrium price is $2.80.
Shortage or Excess Supply at $2.40:
At $2.40, Qd = 8,000 and Qs = 6,400.
Since Qd > Qs, there is a shortage.
The shortage is calculated as Qd - Qs = 8,000 - 6,400 = 1,600 units.
So, the correct answer is:

Equilibrium price: $2.80
Shortage at $2.40: 1,600 units
Therefore, the correct option is: d. $2.40; 1,600 shortage
