To determine the opportunity cost of moving from point B to point C on the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF), we need to look at the change in the quantities of MP3 players and watches.

At point B: 10 MP3 players and 6 watches
At point C: 15 MP3 players and 4 watches
Moving from point B to point C, the production of MP3 players increases by 5 units (from 10 to 15), and the production of watches decreases by 2 units (from 6 to 4).

The opportunity cost of producing 5 more MP3 players is the 2 watches that are no longer produced.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

a. 2 watches

Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple Java program using the JFreeChart library to create a graph of the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) for country X, showing the daily production of MP3 players and watches.

First, make sure you have the JFreeChart library added to your project. You can download it from JFreeChart.
