The opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a decision is made. In this case, since Mariko doesn’t like diet cola, it wouldn’t be considered a valuable alternative for her. Therefore, the opportunity cost of choosing iced tea is the cola, which is the next best alternative she could have chosen.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. The cola.

Sure! Let’s create a simple bar chart in Java to display the opportunity cost of Mariko’s choice. We’ll use the JFreeChart library to visualize the options and highlight the opportunity cost.

First, make sure you have the JFreeChart library added to your project. You can download it from JFreeChart or add it via Maven.
