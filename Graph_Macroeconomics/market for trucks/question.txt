Consider the market for trucks left parenthesis normal good right parenthesis shown at right.
Consider the effect of the following two events on the​ market:
i. New production technology
ii. An increase in average income
​1.) Using the line drawing​ tool, draw new supply and demand​ lines, making sure to properly label the lines. 
​2.) Using the point drawing​ tool, indicate the new equilibrium quantity and price and label this​ 'B'.
Carefully follow the instructions​ above, and only draw the required objects.

Let’s analyze the effects of the two events on the market for trucks:

New Production Technology: This typically increases the efficiency of production, leading to a decrease in production costs. As a result, the supply curve will shift to the right.
An Increase in Average Income: Since trucks are considered a normal good, an increase in average income will lead to an increase in demand. As a result, the demand curve will shift to the right.
Here’s how you can visualize these changes:

Draw the New Supply and Demand Lines:
Shift the original supply curve (S) to the right and label it ‘New Supply’.
Shift the original demand curve (D) to the right and label it ‘New Demand’.
Indicate the New Equilibrium Point:
Identify where the new supply curve intersects the new demand curve.
Plot this point and label it ‘B’.
Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Draw the New Supply Curve: Shift the original supply curve (S) to the right and label it ‘New Supply’.
Draw the New Demand Curve: Shift the original demand curve (D) to the right and label it ‘New Demand’.
Plot the New Equilibrium Point: Identify where the ‘New Supply’ curve intersects the ‘New Demand’ curve and plot this point, labeling it ‘B’.
If you need a visual representation, I can help you generate a Java code to visualize the graph. Would you like that?
