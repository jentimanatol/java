​1.) Using java generate a code to ​, plot the four output combinations from the table above.  Properly label each point.
​2.) Using java generate a code to  the​ 4-point curved line drawing ​, draw a curve connecting these points. Label this curve​ 'PPC'.


The shape of this outward bowed PPC is due to
A.
increased production efficiency.
B.
decreasing opportunity costs.
C.
constant opportunity costs.
D.



The shape of this outward bowed PPC is due to:

D. increasing opportunity costs.

This means that as you produce more of one good, you have to give up increasingly larger amounts of the other good.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!


Sure! Here’s the updated Java code to make the graph bigger, add a grid, and label the axes:

Got it! To create a smooth curve that includes all four points, we can use a spline interpolation. 

Here’s an updated Java code using Path2D to create a smooth curve that passes through all four points:
