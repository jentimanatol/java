The scenario described, where Farmer McDonald can grow either soybeans or corn on his 100 acres of land, and the accompanying figure showing the trade-off between the two crops, refers to the concept of a production possibilities curve (PPC). The PPC illustrates the maximum possible output combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and technology.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. production possibilities curve.

Sure! Here’s a Java code example to visualize a Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) using the JFreeChart library. This code will plot the trade-off between bushels of soybeans and bushels of corn that Farmer McDonald can produce on his 100 acres of land.

First, make sure you have the JFreeChart library added to your project. You can download it from JFreeChart or add it via Maven.
