i have some detailed data to generate a better graph: Suppose the government adopts a policy that forces pesticide producers to bear the social costs of groundwater contamination associated with the use of their product. This policy will 
increase
 the price of pesticides.
Part 2
Since orange growers regard the pesticide as a key input in the production of​ oranges, the market for oranges will obviously be affected. 
Using the line drawing tool​, show how the policy on pesticides impacts the market for oranges. Properly label the line.
Part 3
Carefully follow the instructions​ above, and only draw the required objects.  Part 4
The government policy on pesticides causes the market price of oranges to 
increase
.
Part 5
The government policy on pesticides causes the equilibrium quantity of oranges to 
decrease
.

Great! Let’s use the detailed data to generate a more accurate graph. We’ll plot the demand curve (D) and the initial supply curve (S1) along with the new supply curve (S2) after the policy is implemented.

Here’s the updated Java code to visualize the graph with the provided data:
