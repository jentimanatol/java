Hi Professor,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a review of my grade for your course. As a computer science major, I found this course quite challenging, but I dedicated myself fully and put in my best effort.

This semester, I have maintained a record of all A grades in my other courses. Given my consistent performance and hard work, I would like to request an increase in my grade for this course as well. Your consideration would mean a lot to me.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,
Anatolie Jentimir






Dear Professor 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude for your unwavering support and understanding throughout the course.

Your willingness to accept late work and your readiness to assist us at any time, even on holidays, has been incredibly helpful. Your detailed explanations and thorough teaching methods have made a significant impact on my learning experience.

I also wanted to mention that the two courses I took this semester, Advanced Java and Data Structure, were not only intellectually stimulating but also highly practical. Your teaching made these complex subjects much more approachable and engaging.

Thank you once again for your dedication and kindness. I truly appreciate all that you have done for us.

Sincerely, 

Anatolie Jentimir
