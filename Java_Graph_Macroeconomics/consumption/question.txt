Sure, I can help with that! Let’s break it down step by step:

1. Drawing the Planned Investment Expenditure Curve (Label it ‘I’)
Identify the level of planned investment expenditure: This is usually a constant value since planned investment does not typically change with the level of real GDP.
Draw a horizontal line: From the y-axis at the level of planned investment expenditure. For example, if planned investment is $5 trillion, draw a horizontal line at y = 5 from x = 0 to x = 22.
Label this line ‘I’.
2. Drawing the New Expenditure Function Representing Consumption and Investment (Label it ‘C+I’)
Combine the consumption function © and the planned investment (I): This means adding the value of planned investment to each point on the consumption function.
Shift the consumption function upwards: By the amount of planned investment. For example, if planned investment is $5 trillion, shift the entire consumption function © up by 5 units.
Plot the new points: For example, if the original consumption function © has points (0, 4) and (20, 14), the new points for the combined function (C+I) would be (0, 9) and (20, 19).
Draw the new line: Through these new points.
Label this line ‘C+I’.
3. Indicating the New Equilibrium Level of Real GDP (Label it ‘B’)
Find the intersection of the new expenditure function (C+I) with the 45-degree line: This line represents points where planned expenditure equals real GDP.
Mark the intersection point: This is the new equilibrium level of real GDP.
Label this point ‘B’.
I hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

Sure, let’s calculate the exact coordinates for each line and point you need to draw:

1. Planned Investment Expenditure Curve (Label it ‘I’)
Let’s assume the planned investment expenditure is $5 trillion.
This will be a horizontal line at y = 5.
Coordinates for ‘I’: (0, 5) to (22, 5).
2. New Expenditure Function Representing Consumption and Investment (Label it ‘C+I’)
The original consumption function © has points (0, 4) and (20, 14).
Adding the planned investment of $5 trillion to each point:
New point 1: (0, 4 + 5) = (0, 9)
New point 2: (20, 14 + 5) = (20, 19)
Coordinates for ‘C+I’: (0, 9) to (20, 19).
3. New Equilibrium Level of Real GDP (Label it ‘B’)
The new equilibrium level of real GDP is where the new expenditure function (C+I) intersects the 45-degree line (where y = x).
To find this intersection, we need to solve for x in the equation of the new expenditure function.
The equation of the new expenditure function (C+I) is a straight line, so we can use the slope-intercept form: y = mx + b.
Slope (m) = (19 - 9) / (20 - 0) = 10 / 20 = 0.5
Intercept (b) = 9 (since the line passes through (0, 9))
Equation: y = 0.5x + 9
Set y = x to find the intersection:
x = 0.5x + 9
0.5x = 9
x = 18
Coordinates for ‘B’: (18, 18).
Summary of Coordinates
Planned Investment Expenditure Curve (‘I’): (0, 5) to (22, 5)
New Expenditure Function (‘C+I’): (0, 9) to (20, 19)
New Equilibrium Level of Real GDP (‘B’): (18, 18)
