## Timeliness
Two important skills to master are arriving on time for meetings/classes/work and getting projects/assignments in on time. You will be a more valued student/employee if you are responsible and effective on these fronts. Plan ahead to anticipate obstacles.

## Attendance Policy
Attendance at all in-class meetings is mandatory and will be taken at any time during each class. Two points will be deducted from an individual’s final grade for every absence in excess of two. Consistent lateness will also cause a reduction of points from a student’s final grade.

## Module Exams and/or Quizzes
- There will be one quiz on MyEconLab at the end of each chapter, emphasizing terminology and concepts identified in the text and class lectures. 
- If you are unable to take a scheduled quiz due to an emergency, you are required to contact the professor within twenty-four (24) hours to be eligible to take a make-up quiz.
- There will be two (2) in-class comprehensive exams covering 7 chapters each for the session.

## Weekly Reading
- We will be using one book for this course: *The Macro View* (19th edition, Miller). Reading assignments will be posted on a weekly basis.
- It is important to keep up with the reading. Information in each chapter will be needed to complete the assigned homework and to participate in class discussions.

## Case Studies and Weekly Homework
- There will be small case studies and other chapter exercises assigned throughout this course.
- Homework exercises will be posted each week.
- Assignments must be submitted by the due dates outlined in the course assignments.

All case studies must be submitted in word-processed format, free from spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. No late assignments will be accepted. If you are not able to attend a class in which a written assignment is due, it is your responsibility to submit via email on the due date and submit a hard copy at the next scheduled class.
