Suppose the local government is concerned about the health of local school children, and for that reason imposes a price ceiling of $3 on yogurt. Based on the graph below, which of the following is true?
This graph shows Price on the y-axis and Quantity on the x-axis, as well as a supply line, demand line, and price ceiling line. The price ceiling is a horizontal line at 3 dollars. Three vertical dotted lines highlight where the supply line intersects with the demand line, where the supply line intersects with the price ceiling, and where the demand line intersects with the price ceiling. The supply line intersects with the demand line above the price ceiling line at approximately 4,$5. The supply line intersects with the price ceiling at 3,$3. The demand line intersects with the price ceiling at 5,$3
Question 45Select one:

a.

Let’s analyze the situation based on the given graph and the price ceiling of $3:

The supply line intersects with the price ceiling at a quantity of 3 yogurts.
The demand line intersects with the price ceiling at a quantity of 5 yogurts.
This means that at the price ceiling of $3:

The quantity supplied will be 3 yogurts.
The quantity demanded will be 5 yogurts.
Since the quantity demanded (5 yogurts) is greater than the quantity supplied (3 yogurts), there will be a shortage of 2 yogurts.

So, the correct answer is:

c. The quantity supplied will be 3 yogurts.

Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other questions you have?

generate a java code to show the graph add lines , add labels , and description .



This code creates a graph with the demand and supply lines, as well as the price ceiling. It also labels the axes, provides a title for the graph, and adds annotations to label each point with its name and coordinates.

Make sure you have the JFreeChart and JCommon libraries in your classpath to run this code. You can download them from the JFreeChart website or add them via a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions!
