## Project Overview

The `PriorityQ.app` project demonstrates how to use a priority queue to manage elements based on their priority. This document explains how the insert method works within the priority queue, discusses the use of Huffman coding for data compression, and provides a clear analysis of the results.

## Insert Method in Priority Queue

The insert method in a priority queue is used to add elements to the queue based on their priority. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a New Node**: When the insert method is called, a new node is created with the given value and priority.
2. **Find the Correct Position**: The method finds the correct position in the queue for the new node based on its priority. Higher priority elements are placed before lower priority ones.
3. **Insert the Node**: The new node is inserted into the queue at the determined position.
4. **Adjust the Queue**: The queue is adjusted to maintain the correct order of elements based on their priorities.

### Example

- **Node Class**: Represents an element in the priority queue with a priority and a value.
- **Insert Method**: Creates a new node and finds the correct position in the queue based on the priority.
- **Display Method**: Prints the elements of the queue in order of their priorities.

## Huffman Coding for Data Compression

Huffman coding is a method used for data compression. It reduces storage and transmission costs by encoding data based on symbol frequency. Here's a brief explanation:

- **Prefix Codes**: The codes generated by Huffman coding are prefix codes, meaning no code is a prefix of another. This eliminates ambiguity during decoding, ensuring the compressed data can be accurately reconstructed.
- **Efficiency**: Huffman coding is efficient in reducing the size of the data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols.

## Analysis of Results

The PriorityQ.app demonstrates the effective use of priority queues and Huffman coding. Key takeaways include:

- **Queue Management**: The priority queue efficiently manages elements by maintaining the correct order based on priorities.
- **Data Compression**: Huffman coding significantly reduces data size, making it ideal for storage and transmission.

# Huffman Coding in Java

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Huffman Coding in Java. Huffman Coding is a compression algorithm used to reduce the size of data. The provided code includes classes and methods for constructing a Huffman Tree and generating Huffman Codes for a given set of characters and their frequencies.

## Java Code Implementation

### HuffmanNode Class

The `HuffmanNode` class represents a node in the Huffman Tree. Each node contains:
- `data`: Frequency of the character.
- `c`: The character.
- `left`: Pointer to the left child.
- `right`: Pointer to the right child.

```java
class HuffmanNode {
    int data;
    char c;
    HuffmanNode left;
    HuffmanNode right;
}
```

### MyComparator Class

The `MyComparator` class implements the `Comparator` interface to compare `HuffmanNode` objects based on their frequencies.

```java
class MyComparator implements Comparator<HuffmanNode> {
    public int compare(HuffmanNode x, HuffmanNode y) {
        return x.data - y.data;
    }
}
```

### Huffman Class

The `Huffman` class contains the main logic for building the Huffman Tree and generating the Huffman Codes.

#### printCode Method

Recursively generates the Huffman Code for each character by traversing the Huffman Tree.

```java
public class Huffman {
    public static void printCode(HuffmanNode root, String s) {
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && Character.isLetter(root.c)) {
            System.out.println(root.c + ":" + s);
            return;
        }
        printCode(root.left, s + "0");
        printCode(root.right, s + "1");
    }
}
```

#### main Method

Demonstrates the process of creating the Huffman Tree and printing the Huffman Codes for a set of characters and their frequencies.

```java
public class Huffman {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 6;
        char[] charArray = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' };
        int[] charfreq = { 5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45 };

        PriorityQueue<HuffmanNode> q = new PriorityQueue<HuffmanNode>(n, new MyComparator());

        for (int i = 0; n; i++) {
            HuffmanNode hn = new HuffmanNode();
            hn.c = charArray[i];
            hn.data = charfreq[i];
            hn.left = null;
            hn.right = null;
            q.add(hn);
        }

        HuffmanNode root = null;

        while (q.size() > 1) {
            HuffmanNode x = q.peek();
            q.poll();
            HuffmanNode y = q.peek();
            q.poll();
            HuffmanNode f = new HuffmanNode();
            f.data = x.data + y.data;
            f.c = '-';
            f.left = x;
            f.right = y;
            root = f;
            q.add(f);
        }

        printCode(root, "");
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Creating the Huffman Tree

- Create a priority queue and add all characters with their frequencies.
- Extract two nodes with the lowest frequencies, combine them to form a new node, and add it back to the priority queue.
- Repeat until the priority queue contains only one node, which becomes the root of the Huffman Tree.

### Generating Huffman Codes

- Traverse the Huffman Tree from the root.
- Assign a '0' for the left branch and a '1' for the right branch.
- Continue until all leaf nodes (characters) are reached.

## Results

- **Efficiency**: Huffman Coding is efficient in reducing the size of data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols.
- **Prefix Codes**: The codes generated by Huffman Coding are prefix codes, meaning no code is a prefix of another. This eliminates ambiguity during decoding, ensuring that the compressed data can be accurately reconstructed.

## Conclusion

The implementation of Huffman Coding in Java demonstrates its effectiveness in data compression. The priority queue and Huffman Tree provide a systematic way to manage and compress data efficiently.
