# ECO 202 (Section 200H): MICROECONOMICS 

## Course Description
This course covers an introduction to the market system. It covers:
- Basic demand and supply analysis
- Theory of consumer choice
- Demand and supply elasticity
- Long run and short run cost curves
- Price and output determination under different market structures, such as perfect competition, monopoly, and monopolistic competition

The course applies microeconomic principles for analyzing government regulations. It satisfies the College’s General Education requirement for Community and Cultural Contexts.

**Prerequisites:** Foundations of Algebra (MAT097) or Pre-Statistics (MAT098) and Reading Skills II (RDG095) or placement.

## Specific Course Goals
The primary objective of this course is to teach you the language and method of economics through concepts and visual representation translated from models. By the end of the course, you should be able to:
1. Understand how rational individuals make decisions about economic activity while dealing with constraints imposed by limited resources (scarcity).
2. Engage in debates about the role of government in correcting market inefficiencies.
3. Think critically about what you hear or read in the media and from candidates running for office about various policies to regulate or restrict economic activity.
4. Use graphs and quantitative relationships to express economic & decision-making models.

## Course Textbook (Optional & Available at BHCC Bookstore)
**Microeconomics, 5th (or earlier) Edition, by Perloff.** Additional readings may be assigned and distributed in class.

## Course Format & Expectations
The teaching procedure will include both lecture and discussion/group activities. Students are expected to:
- Come to class having completed the reading assignment and be prepared to participate in discussion.
- There will be brief video presentations, a midterm, 1 short take-home assignment, and a final project given as BOTH a research paper and a PowerPoint presentation.
- Attendance is mandatory as students will be reporting progress on their final project through milestone presentations. Grades will be reduced for late assignments and missing class.

## Grading & Requirements
Students will be evaluated in the following manner:
- **1 Take Home Assignment** – 40%
- **Midterm** – 25%
- **Final Project** – 35%

### Take Home Assignment
There will be one take home assignment. It will be based mainly on problems from your text, but may be supplemented by lecture. In the assignment, you will be asked to explain concepts, draw graphs, and solve problems. The math required will be simple arithmetic involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There may be extra credit problems for those with stronger math backgrounds that may require algebra. Although many of the concepts of microeconomics are expressed through calculus, calculus will not be used in this course.

The purpose of these assignments is to practice and hone your budding economic analysis skills. They will also prepare you for the exam as problems on the exam will be very similar to the assignment. You are encouraged to work in groups, but you are certainly welcome to work alone. It’s up to you. There will not be any additional points awarded to either format. However, you are required to submit your own paper and if you do work in groups, please acknowledge the names of your team. You may also consult resources other than your textbook such as websites on the internet. For all quantitative problems, please show your work completely for full credit.

### Required Final Project (35% of Grade: Final Draft Due on the Last Day of Class)
The key to the Honors Section is the completion of a final project. Students must complete an in-depth analysis of a publicly traded firm in the U.S as their final project. For this assignment, you will:
1. Choose a publicly traded firm. You may select from a list uploaded on Moodle.
2. Present the data collected from the firm’s annual report and other industry information found online and analyze them in conjunction with the models and core principles to explain the market decisions of supply and demand and pricing and place the firm in the market position of the industry.
3. Make recommendations about the firm’s sustainability and actions it can take to ensure success.

The project is divided into three milestones, which will be submitted at various points throughout the course to scaffold learning and ensure a quality final submission. The format of all final project deliverables will be a research report (7-9 pages) and a PowerPoint presentation (up to 10 slides) with speaker note narratives. You will also be asked to present your project in the last 2-3 weeks of the course.
